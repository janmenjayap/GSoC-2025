---------

The proposal submitted and accepted for the Google Summer of Code 2025 at SageMath can be found here:
:download:`Link <_static/proposal.pdf>`.

The primary objective of this project is to implement the Micali-Vazirani algorithm efficiently for finding
maximum cardinality matching in an undirected graph within SageMath by developing the
:meth:`MicaliVaziraniMatching` class and updating the ``matching()`` and other associated methods in the
``sage.graphs.matching`` module.
